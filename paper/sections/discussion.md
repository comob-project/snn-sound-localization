## What went well

The decision to start from the code base of the [Cosyne tutorial](https://neural-reckoning.github.io/cosyne-tutorial-2022/) {cite:p}`10.5281/zenodo.7044500` was very helpful. It meant that users had a clear entry path for the project without needing prior expertise, and a code base that was designed to be easy to understand. In addition, the popularity of the tutorial (over 30k views on YouTube at the time of writing) meant that many people heard about this project and were interested in participating. In addition, the GitHub-based infrastructure allowed for asynchronous work and a website that was automatically updated each time anyone made a change to their code or to the text of the paper.

By providing models which used spiking neurons to transform sensory inputs into behavioural outputs, participants were free to explore in virtually any direction they wished, much like an open-world or sandbox video game. Indeed over the course of the project we explored the full sensory-motor transformation from manipulating the nature of the input signals to perturbing unit activity and assessing network behaviour. Consequently, our code forms an excellent basis for teaching, as concepts from across neuroscience can be introduced and then implemented in class. In this direction, we integrated our project into two university courses and provide slides and a highly annotated python notebook, for those interested in teaching with these models.  

Beyond providing teaching and hands-on research experience, the project also offered many opportunities for participants to improve their "soft" scientific skills. For early career researchers (undergraduate and master's students) these included learning how to work with Git, collaborate with researchers from diverse countries and career stages, and contribute to a scientific publication. For later career researchers (PhD, Postdoc) the project provided many supervision and leadership opportunities. For example, during online workshops, later career participants were encouraged to lead small groups focussed on tackling specific questions.  

## What went wrong
While our sandbox design offered several advantages (discussed above), the open nature of the process did present three challenges. Our first challenge was standardising work across participants; for example, ensuring that everyone used the same code and hyperparameters. Along these lines, future projects would benefit from having participants dedicated to maintaining the code base and standardising participants work.

Our second challenge, was the project's exploratory nature. While this appealed to many participants, the lack of a clear goal or end-point may have been off-putting to others. For future efforts, one alternative would be to define clear goals *a priori*, however if handled carelessly, this runs the risk of reducing to a to-do list passed from more senior to more junior researchers. A more appealing alternative could be to structure the project in clearly defined phases. For example, early months reviewing literature could be followed by a period of proposals and question refinement, before a final stretch of research. Another alternative, would be to begin by collecting project proposals and allowing participants to vote on a project to pursue. This could be done by having each participant check a box for each project they would choose to work on if it were selected, and then selecting the project with the most checks (thereby maximising the expected number of participants). Multiple projects could even be launched simultaneously if this approach proved popular. 

A third challenge, which arose towards the end of the project, was how to fairly assign credit. We had initially - and perhaps somewhat idealistically - stated that anyone who contributed to the project, either by writing code or participating in one of the workshops, would be included on the author list. To the extent that it was possible, we have followed through with this, though we were simply unable to contact several of the participants and so could not include them as authors. Another issue with this system is that participants with unequal contributions, e.g. attending a workshop vs contributing an entire section of the paper, would be assigned similar credit, i.e. authorship. To resolve this, we experimented with using the number or size of GitHub commits to order authors, however we found that these metrics did not accurately reflect contributions. For example, it may be quicker to commit a large-amount of low quality text than a concise well written section, and similarly there is no good reason to distinguish between two authors who submit the same amount of work through a different number of commits. We attempted to address this challenge by providing a contributions table [](#contributors) and agreeing an author order. This order was agreed on unanimously, though could easily cause issues in other projects. Consequently, we recommend that a strategy for credit assignment be determined collaboratively at the start of the project, and made explicit so that participants can clearly understand how their contribution will translate to credit. Alternatively, such projects could publish under a pseudonym, e.g. COMOB.    

Ultimately, while the project explored many interesting directions, which will form the basis for future work, we did not reach a point where we could draw strong scientific conclusions about sound localization. From group discussions we concluded that this is likely due to the free-form nature of our project, which would have benefited from a more coordinated approach. The question is, how to do this without compromising the ideals of a grass-roots project? Extending the voting idea above, one approach would be to make the proposer of the, democratically selected, project responsible for making sure that results are comparable and generally keeping the project on the right track. A role similar to a traditional supervisor, but with the critical difference that they are elected by their peers and only on a project by project basis. 

## Conclusions

This paper does not present a scientific breakthrough. However, it does demonstrate the feasibility of open research projects which bring together large number of participants across countries and career stages to work together collaboratively on scientific projects. Moreover, several follow-up research projects are planned based on pilot data from our work, and we plan to launch a second COMOB project soon.
