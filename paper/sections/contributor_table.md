Hello contributors! I have inserted a table of names, websites and GitHub usernames of contributors from the repository below. There is a lot of information missing. Please can you submit pull requests modifying the file [paper/sections/contributor_table.md](https://github.com/comob-project/snn-sound-localization/blob/main/paper/sections/contributor_table.md) to update your information, and also get in touch with us if you would like to be listed as an author. Either email [Dan Goodman](mailto:d.goodman@imperial.ac.uk) or join the [SNUFA discord channel](https://discord.gg/aYvgGakrVK) ``#sound-localisation-paper``.
```

If you add a contribution, please use one of the following templates (see examples below):

* Wrote the paper (plus which section if you would like to specify)
* Conducted research (please give a link to your notebook formatted like this ``[](../research/3-Starting-Notebook.ipynb)``, or specify another sort of contribution)
* Supervised research (please give the name of your supervisee)
